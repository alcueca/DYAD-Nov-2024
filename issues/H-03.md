# The Kerosine Manager is used as a Non-Kerosine Licenser

## Impact
Kerosine can't be used as collateral.

## Severity
Likelihood: High - There are no preconditions.
Impact: High - Core invariant broken.
Severity: High

This is a separate report from H-02 because the issue is that the kerosine manager list of non-kerosine vaults is used as a kerosine vault licenser. H-02 points out that the contract deployment is flawed.

## Description
In VaultManagerV2.sol#L88 we use `keroseneManager.isLicensed(vault)` to identify if a vault is licensed by the kerosine manager to be used as a collateral. The kerosine manager actually contains the non-kerosine vaults that should be used to calculate the kerosine price. If we would be to add the kerosine vaults to the kerosine manager, we could break the invariant that kerosine vaults can't be used as exogenous collateral.

In VaultManagerV2.sol#L281 we use `keroseneManager.isLicensed(vault)` again, to similar effect.

## Proof of Concept
Insert the following test into `test/fork/v2.t.sol`, and run it on a mainnet fork:

```
  function testAddKerosineVaultReverts_Debug() public {
    DNft dNft = DNft(MAINNET_DNFT);
    
    // We reset the DNft contract to be able to mint free DNfts
    vm.etch(address(MAINNET_DNFT), address(new DNft()).code);
    dNft = DNft(MAINNET_DNFT);

    uint id = dNft.mintNft(address(this));

    // Obtain kerosene
    vm.prank(MAINNET_OWNER);
    ERC20(MAINNET_KEROSENE).transfer(address(this), 100_000_000 ether); // This is a huge amount because the surplus collateral is low and the unitary price of kerosine is also low.

    // Deposit kerosene
    ERC20(MAINNET_KEROSENE).approve(address(contracts.vaultManager), 100_000_000 ether);
    contracts.vaultManager.deposit(id, address(contracts.unboundedKerosineVault), 100_000_000 ether);
  }
```

We revert with:
```

## Recommendation
Don't add the kerosine vault to the vault manager licenser. Use a separate licenser for kerosine vaults. ALternatively, add an `isLicensedKerosine` function to the licenser.
