# Liquidations will be unprofitable well before the solvency threshold

## Impact
The protocol will accrue bad debt more often than it should.

## Severity
Likelihood: Medium - Liquidations need to happen far from the liquidation threshold.
Impact: Medium - The protocol will accrue bad debt.
Severity: Medium

## Description
The liquidation mechanism rewards liquidators with a 20% of the overcollateralization for each liquidated note. For a position liquidated at 110% collateralization, the liquidator would get 2% of the collateral to cover their costs, which include capital costs such as paying for flash loans and operational costs such as gas and bot running.

In the scenario above, the liquidated note would still keep 8% of the collateral, while the liquidator might choose it is not profitable to liquidate it. There are better designs to avoid this problem.

## Proof of Concept

Insert the following test into `test/fork/v2.t.sol`, and run it on a mainnet fork:

```

```



```

```

## Recommendation

The liquidation mechanism could favour the liquidator to have the best chance of removing notes from the protocol before they become insolvent. For example, if the overcollateralization value is below 10% of the debt value, the liquidator should get all the collateral.
