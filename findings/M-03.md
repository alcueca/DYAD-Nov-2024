# Liquidators don't get the expected returns

## Impact
The implementation doesn't match the specifications

## Severity
Likelihood: High - No preconditions.
Impact: Low - It still works, just not exactly in the way intended.
Severity: Medium

## Description
The [documentation](https://dyadstable.notion.site/DYAD-design-outline-v6-3fa96f99425e458abbe574f67b795145) states:
> If a Note’s collateral value in USD drops below 150% of its DYAD minted balance, it faces liquidation. The liquidator burns a quantity of DYAD equal to the target Note’s DYAD minted balance, and in return receives an equivalent value plus a 20% bonus of the target Note’s backing colateral

The implementation gives to the liquidator a 20% of the target Note’s overcollateralization, which is different from the 20% bonus of the backing collateral. For a position backed with 1.5 ETH and with a debt equivalent to 1 ETH, the liquidator will get 20% of 0.5 ETH, which is 0.1 ETH, and not 20% of 1.5 ETH, which is 0.3 ETH.

## Proof of Concept

Insert the following test into `test/fork/v2.t.sol`, and run it on a mainnet fork:

```

```



```

```

## Recommendation

Probably just update the documentation to match the implementation, which makes more sense.
